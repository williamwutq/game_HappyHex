/**
 * A lightweight graphical component used to render a single hexagonal cell on a 2D plane.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code Hexagon} instance is associated with a {@link Block} that provides its state (occupied or not)
 * and its Cartesian coordinates. This component is suitable for visualizing a large collection of such
 * blocks in a hexagonal grid-based display.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, one should subclass it and implement the {@link #fetchBlock()} method to supply
 * the correct {@code Block} for rendering. All hexagons are drawn at the same global size, set by
 * {@link #setSize(double)}, which should be synchronized across the entire display. Upon size changes,
 * it's recommended to repaint all active hexagons.
 * <p>
 * This class is not designed to be used in lightweight component hierarchies (e.g., containers). For simple,
 * fixed-use cases (e.g., rendering only a few static blocks), copy the rendering logic instead of using
 * this component directly.
 * @version 1.0 (HappyHex 1.3)
