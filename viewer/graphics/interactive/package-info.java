/**
 * Provides custom Swing-based interactive graphical components designed for
 * modern user interfaces with emphasis on visual clarity, geometric aesthetics,
 * and fine control over user interactions.
 * <p>
 * The {@code viewer.graphics.interactive} package includes several specialized
 * components tailored for visual interfaces in applications such as games,
 * simulations, educational software, and digital displays. These components
 * emphasize minimalistic styling, pixel-level customization, performance-aware
 * rendering, and support for intuitive user input and animation.
 *
 * <h2>Component Overview</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.SpeedSlider} –
 *       A custom horizontal slider with a smooth, animated knob rendered as a
 *       rounded hexagon. Suitable for real-time control of parameters like
 *       speed, intensity, or volume. Thread-safe and visually modern.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.SevenSegment} –
 *       A lightweight component that simulates a single character of a
 *       seven-segment LED-style display. Supports digits, alphabetic characters,
 *       and select punctuation. Fully scalable and customizable.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.NameIndicator} –
 *       A button-based multi-character display using a row of
 *       {@code SevenSegment} components. Provides cursor-aware editing of
 *       hexadecimal or alphanumeric input. Common in embedded-style UI mockups
 *       or games.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.GeneralIndicator} –
 *       A fixed-string version of {@code NameIndicator}, useful for static
 *       displays. The string can be updated via method call but not modified
 *       interactively by the user.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.Hexagon} –
 *       An abstract class for rendering single hexagonal tiles associated with a
 *       logical {@code Block} unit. Not intended for lightweight UI
 *       hierarchies. Subclass and implement {@code fetchBlock()} for use.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.Keyboard} –
 *       A 5×5 on-screen hex keyboard component with round buttons for hexadecimal
 *       or symbolic command input. Dynamically resizes and styles its layout.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link viewer.graphics.interactive.HexButton} –
 *       An abstract class for a JButton styled with a smooth, rounded hexagonal
 *       outline. Handles hover effects and drawable path filling. Subclass to
 *       define behavior and custom visuals. Uses anti-aliasing and caching for
 *       efficient rendering.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Geometry-aware rendering:</b> Many components use hexagons or digital-style segments.</li>
 *   <li><b>Thread-safe interaction:</b> Asynchronous animation is handled carefully (e.g. {@code SpeedSlider}).</li>
 *   <li><b>Scalability:</b> Most components recalculate geometry on size change and support high-DPI displays.</li>
 *   <li><b>Customization:</b> Components allow programmatic control and support subclassing for extended use.</li>
 *   <li><b>No child containment:</b> Components like {@code HexButton} are rendered and handled entirely within their own context.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Intended Use Cases</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Custom user interfaces for simulations, dashboards, or puzzle games</li>
 *   <li>Digital instrument panels and virtual hardware controls</li>
 *   <li>Touchscreen input simulations</li>
 *   <li>Modern UI prototypes with emphasis on responsiveness and style</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety and Performance</h2>
 * Components that perform animations (e.g., {@code SpeedSlider}) are designed with thread safety
 * in mind, using background threads for animations. Many classes use caching mechanisms for
 * graphical elements (such as paths or polygons) to avoid recalculation during rendering passes.
 * Where applicable, users should trigger {@code repaint()} manually after updating rendering parameters.
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * The components in this package rely only on standard AWT and Swing libraries:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code javax.swing.*}</li>
 *   <li>{@code java.awt.*}</li>
 *   <li>{@code java.awt.geom.*}</li>
 *   <li>{@code java.util.*} (for animation utilities and caching)</li>
 * </ul>
