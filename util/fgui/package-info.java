/**
 * Functional, modern GUI library based on Java Swing.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * FGUI (Functional GUI) is a lightweight, modern GUI library built on top of Java
 * Swing. It provides a functional programming approach to building user interfaces,
 * making it easier to create and manage complex UIs. This package is a simple library,
 * and does not provide concrete implementation of specific UIs.
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * The only dependency for this package is the standard Java Swing library ({@code javax.swing}),
 * the Java AWT library ({@code java.awt}), the Java Function library ({@code java.util.function}),
 * the {@code util.function} library, and the {@code util.dynamic} library.
 * <p>
 * These libraries are used to handle the core GUI components and event handling, provide functional
 * programming constructs, support dynamic properties commonly used in animations, and provide backward
 * compatibility with the main gui package.
