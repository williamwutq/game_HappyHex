     * A custom {@link CircularButton} that represents a quit button for the AutoplayInteractive component.
     * <p>
     * The {@code QuitButton} extends {@link CircularButton} to provide a specialized button with a custom
     * arrow-shaped path, resembling a "quit" or "exit" symbol, and animated color transitions between a
     * normal and hover state. It uses a {@link DynamicColor} to smoothly transition between two colors
     * (normal and hover) when the mouse enters or exits the button, triggering a repaint to reflect the
     * updated color. Clicking the button invokes the {@link AutoplayInteractive#quitGame()} method to
     * exit the game.
     * <p>
     * The button's shape is a circular boundary (inherited from {@link CircularButton}) with a custom
     * inner path defined as a stylized arrow, scaled to 75% of the button's radius with a fixed width
     * for the arrow lines. The color of the arrow is dynamically updated using the {@link DynamicColor}
     * instance, which animates between the normal color ({@code quitNormalColor}) and hover color
     * ({@code quitHoverColor}) using a sigmoid interpolation curve.
     * <p>
     * This class overrides key methods from {@link CircularButton} to implement:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Custom arrow-shaped path rendering via {@link #createCustomPath(int, int, double)}.</li>
     *   <li>Dynamic color retrieval via {@link #getColor()} using the {@link DynamicColor} instance.</li>
     *   <li>Mouse hover interactions via {@link #mouseEntered(MouseEvent)} and {@link #mouseExited(MouseEvent)}
     *       to start or restart the color animation.</li>
     *   <li>Action handling via {@link #actionPerformed(ActionEvent)} to trigger game exit.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The button is designed to be thread-safe, as the {@link DynamicColor} handles its animations in a
     * background thread and ensures synchronized access to shared state. The {@code repaint()} method is
     * called via the {@link DynamicColor}'s GUI updater to reflect color changes in the Swing Event Dispatch
     * Thread (EDT).
