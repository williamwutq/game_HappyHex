 * Represents a simple fixed-length queue of {@code Piece} objects.

 * it always maintains a fixed-size array of elements, and whenever
 * an element is removed (via {@link #next()} or {@link #fetch(int)}),
 * a new element is immediately generated to fill the gap.
 * <p>
 * {@link Piece} objects are always used as reference to static pieces,
 * so practically the {@code Queue} only store an array of references.
 * There is no differentiation between deep and shallow copies.
 * <p>
 * It supports peeking and consuming elements from the front or
 * at specific indices (with shifting), but does not allow adding
 * externally-defined elements. New pieces are created via an
 * internal {@link #generate()} method.
